# Intro

Kotlin CodeQA support is not default confgiured in Android Studio or Gradle just yet as of fall 2018. This is a simple app project to 
show how to confgiure the static analysis tool detekt and the spotless lin formatting checker.

In short words FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, Classcycle, etc is replace by just using two tools.

# Why

As a Senior Android Developer one of my tasks is not only to ensure proper formatting of code and docs on projects but also to 
ensure that proper code architecture guidelines are enforced in my code and code of other developers. Thus, this is one of the 
first task I complete in pickingup new languages such as Kotlin, ie figure out how to get some code quality checks configured.
